# Bubble Sort- A sorting method which sorts by comparing
# two adjacent elements, starting at the beginning of the list,
# and switching them if they're in the wrong order. It them moves to the next
# adjacent pair of elements (which would include one of the previous elements).
# Working this way, larger elements "bubble" to the end of a list, leaving one
# element fully sorted on each iterations.

# 1. Compare first two elements.
# 	-If they are correctly ordered, move to next two.
# 	-If not switch the order.
# 2. Compare next two elements as above
# 3. Continue until there are no elements left to be sorted.
